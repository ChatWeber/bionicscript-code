                Our bionic reading converter is designed to convert various forms of text into a more accessible and
                easier to read format. This includes PDF documents, Wikipedia pages, and text from online forms.

            </p>
            <p>
                However, it is important to note that the accuracy and formatting of the converted text may vary
                depending on the original source and formatting of the text. While we strive to provide the most
                accurate and readable bionic text possible, there may be errors or inconsistencies that arise during the
                conversion process.

                substitute for professional advice, and we make no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy
                or completeness of the converted text.
